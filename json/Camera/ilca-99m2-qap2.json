New \"S&Q\" mode supports slow motion and quick motion effects, with frame rates from 1fps to 120fps (100fps) selectable in eight steps for up to 60x (50x) quick motion and 5x (4x) slow motion, recordable at full-HD (50Mbps) quality. You can \"play with time\" by compressing the movement of the sun and clouds into a short sequence or extending a peaceful moment to give it a greater sense of relaxation. Then accent ordinary footage with these interludes to add comic or dramatic emphasis.","shot":{"imageFamily":{"images":{"desktop":{"externalUrl":"//sonyglobal.scene7.com/is/image/gwtprod/3b3a0eb47a90038736994cdaceae4f8b?fmt=jpeg","md5":"3b3a0eb47a90038736994cdaceae4f8b"}}}}},{"headline":"Movie functions for a professional workflow","bodyCopy":"Whether you're a commercial photographer or an advanced enthusiast, α99 II is ready to show professional performance.
