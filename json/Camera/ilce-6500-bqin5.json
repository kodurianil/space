Also, when [Focus Area] parameter is set to [Flexible Spot] or [Expand Flexible Spot] the metering spot location can be linked to the focus area (selectable from Centre/Focus Point Link). Moreover, standard exposure value can be adjusted from -1 to +1 stop in 1/6-stop increments and set separately for each metering mode.","shot":{"imageFamily":{"images":{"desktop":{"externalUrl":"//sonyglobal.scene7.com/is/image/gwtprod/388956093c1a09ef957e287980071b48?fmt=jpeg","md5":"388956093c1a09ef957e287980071b48"}}}}},{"headline":"Priority Set in AWB","bodyCopy":"When white balance is set to Auto and incandescent lamps or similar illumination are the light sources, the colour tone priority can be set to [Standard], [Ambience] or [White].
